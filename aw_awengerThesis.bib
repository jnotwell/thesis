  abstract = {Satb2 is a DNA-binding protein that regulates chromatin organization
	and gene expression. In the developing brain, Satb2 is expressed
	in cortical neurons that extend axons across the corpus callosum.
	To assess the role of Satb2 in neurons, we analyzed mice in which
	the Satb2 locus was disrupted by insertion of a LacZ gene. In mutant
	mice, beta-galactosidase-labeled axons are absent from the corpus
	callosum and instead descend along the corticospinal tract. Satb2
	mutant neurons acquire expression of Ctip2, a transcription factor
	that is necessary and sufficient for the extension of subcortical
	projections by cortical neurons. Conversely, ectopic expression of
	Satb2 in neural stem cells markedly decreases Ctip2 expression. Finally,
	we find that Satb2 binds directly to regulatory regions of Ctip2
	and induces changes in chromatin structure. These data suggest that
	Satb2 functions as a repressor of Ctip2 and regulatory determinant
	of corticocortical connections in the developing cerebral cortex.},

	We examine the intersection between syntenically conserved sequences
	in the human, mouse and rat genomes, and sequence similarities within
	the human genome itself, in search of families of non-protein-coding
	elements. For this purpose we develop a graph theoretic clustering
	algorithm, akin to the highly successful methods used in elucidating
	protein sequence family relationships. The algorithm is applied to
	a highly filtered set of about 700 000 human-rodent evolutionarily
	conserved regions, not resembling any known coding sequence, which
	encompasses 3.7% of the human genome. From these, we obtain roughly
	12 000 non-singleton clusters, dense in significant sequence similarities.
	Further analysis of genomic location, evidence of transcription and
	RNA secondary structure reveals many clusters to be significantly
	homogeneous in one or more characteristics. This subset of the highly
	conserved non-protein-coding elements in the human genome thus contains

	and challenging problems toward the functional annotation of the

	sites are often organized in clusters called cis-regulatory modules
	(CRM). While the prediction of individual TF-binding sites is a notoriously
	difficult problem, CRM prediction has proven to be somewhat more
	reliable. Starting from a set of predicted binding sites for more
	than 200 TF families documented in Transfac, we describe an algorithm
	relying on the principle that CRMs generally contain several phylogenetically
	conserved binding sites for a few different TFs. The method allows
	the prediction of more than 118,000 CRMs within the human genome.
	A subset of these is shown to be bound in vivo by TFs using ChIP-chip.
	Their analysis reveals, among other things, that CRM density varies
	widely across the genome, with CRM-rich regions often being located
	near genes encoding transcription factors involved in development.
	Predicted CRMs show a surprising enrichment near the 3' end of genes
	and in regions far from genes. We document the tendency for certain
	TFs to bind modules located in specific regions with respect to their
	target genes and identify TFs likely to be involved in tissue-specific
	regulation. The set of predicted CRMs, which is made available as
	a public database called PReMod (http://genomequebec.mcgill.ca/PReMod),

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The evolutionary conservation of transcriptional mechanisms
	has been widely exploited to understand human biology and disease.
	Recent findings, however, unexpectedly showed that the transcriptional
	regulators hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha and -4alpha rarely
	bind to the same genes in mice and humans, leading to the proposal
	that tissue-specific transcriptional regulation has undergone extensive
	divergence in the two species. Such observations have major implications
	for the use of mouse models to understand HNF-1alpha- and HNF-4alpha-deficient
	diabetes. However, the significance of studies that assess binding
	without considering regulatory function is poorly understood. RESEARCH
	DESIGN AND METHODS: We compared previously reported mouse and human
	HNF-1alpha and HNF-4alpha binding studies with independent binding
	experiments. We also integrated binding studies with mouse and human
	loss-of-function gene expression datasets. RESULTS: First, we confirmed
	the existence of species-specific HNF-1alpha and -4alpha binding,
	yet observed incomplete detection of binding in the different datasets,
	causing an underestimation of binding conservation. Second, only
	a minor fraction of HNF-1alpha- and HNF-4alpha-bound genes were downregulated
	in the absence of these regulators. This subset of functional targets
	did not show evidence for evolutionary divergence of binding or binding
	sequence motifs. Finally, we observed differences between conserved
	and species-specific binding properties. For example, conserved binding
	was more frequently located near transcriptional start sites and
	was more likely to involve multiple binding events in the same gene.
	CONCLUSIONS: Despite evolutionary changes in binding, essential direct
	transcriptional functions of HNF-1alpha and -4alpha are largely conserved
	between mice and humans.},

	a limited understanding of chromatin structure, as various chromatin
	factors cooperate in complex ways to orchestrate transcription. In
	order to quantify chromtain interactions, it is thus necessary to
	devise a robust similarity metric applicable to ChIPseq data. Unfortunately,
	moving past simple overlap calculations to give statistically rigorous
	comparisons of ChIPseq datasets often involves arbitrary choices

	width, and can rigorously model peak location biases by evaluating
	similarity conditioned on a restricted set of genomic regions (such

	be used to infer the strongest binders for a given DNA or RNA binding

	Recently, important new modifications of the SELEX protocol have

	of transcription factor binding motifs (TFBMs) that form the building
	blocks of promoters and other regulatory elements. Identifying these
	experimentally is very laborious, and the number of TFBMs discovered
	remains relatively small, especially when compared with the hundreds
	of transcription factor genes predicted in metazoan genomes. We have
	used a recently developed statistical motif discovery approach, NestedMICA,
	to detect candidate TFBMs from a large set of Drosophila melanogaster
	promoter regions. Of the 120 motifs inferred in our initial analysis,
	25 were statistically significant matches to previously reported
	motifs, while 87 appeared to be novel. Analysis of sequence conservation
	and motif positioning suggested that the great majority of these
	discovered motifs are predictive of functional elements in the genome.
	Many motifs showed associations with specific patterns of gene expression
	in the D. melanogaster embryo, and we were able to obtain confident
	annotation of expression patterns for 25 of our motifs, including
	eight of the novel motifs. The motifs are available through Tiffin,
	a new database of DNA sequence motifs. We have discovered many new
	motifs that are overrepresented in D. melanogaster promoter regions,
	and offer several independent lines of evidence that these are novel
	TFBMs. Our motif dictionary provides a solid foundation for further
	investigation of regulatory elements in Drosophila, and demonstrates
	techniques that should be applicable in other species. We suggest
	that further improvements in computational motif discovery should
	narrow the gap between the set of known motifs and the total number

	700 members of the poly-ZF family of putative transcriptional repressors,

	of the gene family across the tree of life indicates that the gene

	by functional divergence. The ancestral gene family has probably
	expanded independently in several lineages, including mammals and

	Many methods have been developed to identify conserved sequences

	acting on the pattern of mutations. RESULTS: We present a new approach
	that takes advantage of deeply sequenced clades to identify evolutionary
	selection by uncovering not only signatures of rate-based conservation
	but also substitution patterns characteristic of sequence undergoing
	natural selection. We describe a new statistical method for modeling
	biased nucleotide substitutions, a learning algorithm for inferring
	site-specific substitution biases directly from sequence alignments
	and a hidden Markov model for detecting constrained elements characterized
	by biased substitutions. We show that the new approach can identify
	significantly more degenerate constrained sequences than rate-based
	methods. Applying it to the ENCODE regions, we identify as much as
	10.2% of these regions are under selection. AVAILABILITY: The algorithms
	are implemented in a Java software package, called SiPhy, freely

	chromosomes by comparing the mouse and human genomes. From whole-genome
	sequence alignments, 344 large (>100-kb) blocks of conserved synteny
	are evident, but these are further fragmented by smaller-scale evolutionary
	events. Excluding transposon insertions, on average in each megabase
	of genomic alignment we observe two inversions, 17 duplications (five
	tandem or nearly tandem), seven transpositions, and 200 deletions
	of 100 bases or more. This includes 160 inversions and 75 duplications
	or transpositions of length >100 kb. The frequencies of these smaller
	events are not substantially higher in finished portions in the assembly.
	Many of the smaller transpositions are processed pseudogenes; we
	define a "syntenic" subset of the alignments that excludes these
	and other small-scale transpositions. These alignments provide evidence
	that approximately 2% of the genes in the human/mouse common ancestor
	have been deleted or partially deleted in the mouse. There also appears
	to be slightly less nontransposon-induced genome duplication in the
	mouse than in the human lineage. Although some of the events we detect
	are possibly due to misassemblies or missing data in the current
	genome sequence or to the limitations of our methods, most are likely
	to represent genuine evolutionary events. To make these observations,
	we developed new alignment techniques that can handle large gaps
	in a robust fashion and discriminate between orthologous and paralogous

	projection neurons, which are concentrated in the upper layers of
	the cortex, and subcortical projection neurons, which are found in
	the deep layers. Early progenitor cells in the ventricular zone produce
	deep layer neurons that express transcription factors including Sox5,
	Fezf2, and Ctip2, which play important roles in the specification
	of subcortically projecting axons. Upper layer neurons are produced
	from progenitors in the subventricular zone, and the expression of
	Satb2 in these differentiating neurons is required for the formation
	of axonal projections that connect the two cerebral hemispheres.
	The Fezf2/Ctip2 and Satb2 pathways appear to be mutually repressive,
	thus ensuring that individual neurons adopt either a subcortical
	or callosal projection neuron identity at early times during development.
	The molecular mechanisms by which Satb2 regulates gene expression
	involves long-term epigenetic changes in chromatin configuration,
	which may enable cell fate decisions to be maintained during development.},

	elements are notoriously difficult to locate and may reside at considerable
	distances from the transcription units on which they operate and,
	moreover, may be incorporated into the structure of neighbouring

	element. Shh, normally expressed in the ZPA posteriorly in the limb
	bud, is expressed in an additional ectopic site at the anterior margin

	ectopic Shh expression identified the enhancer element that drives
	normal Shh expression in the ZPA. The regulator, designated ZRS,
	lies within intron 5 of the Lmbr1 gene 1 Mb from the target gene
	Shh. The ZRS drives the early spatio-temporal expression pattern
	in the limb of tetrapods. Despite the morphological differences between
	limbs and fins, an equivalent regulatory element is found in fish.
	The ZRS contains point mutations that segregate with polydactyly
	in four unrelated families with PPD and in the Hx mouse mutant. Thus
	point mutations residing in long-range regulatory elements are capable
	of causing congenital abnormalities, and possess the capacity to
	modify gene activity such that a novel gamut of abnormalities is

	in gene regulation are likely to play a major role. Here we performed
	a thorough evolutionary analysis of the largest family of primate
	transcription factors, the Krüppel-type zinc finger (KZNF) gene family.
	We identified and curated gene and pseudogene models for KZNFs in
	three primate species, chimpanzee, orangutan and rhesus macaque,
	to allow for a comparison with the curated set of human KZNFs. We
	show that the recent evolutionary history of primate KZNFs has been
	complex, including many lineage-specific duplications and deletions.
	We found 213 species-specific KZNFs, among them 7 human-specific
	and 23 chimpanzee-specific genes. Two human-specific genes were validated
	experimentally. Ten genes have been lost in humans and 13 in chimpanzees,
	either through deletion or pseudogenization. We also identified 30
	KZNF orthologs with human-specific and 42 with chimpanzee-specific
	sequence changes that are predicted to affect DNA binding properties
	of the proteins. Eleven of these genes show signatures of accelerated
	evolution, suggesting positive selection between humans and chimpanzees.
	During primate evolution the most extensive re-shaping of the KZNF
	repertoire, including most gene additions, pseudogenizations, and
	structural changes occurred within the subfamily homininae. Using
	zinc finger (ZNF) binding predictions, we suggest potential impact
	these changes have had on human gene regulatory networks. The large
	species differences in this family of TFs stands in stark contrast
	to the overall high conservation of primate genomes and potentially
	represents a potent driver of primate evolution.},

	we made use of extreme evolutionary sequence conservation as a filter
	to identify putative gene regulatory elements, and characterized
	the in vivo enhancer activity of a large group of non-coding elements
	in the human genome that are conserved in human-pufferfish, Takifugu
	(Fugu) rubripes, or ultraconserved in human-mouse-rat. We tested

	enhancer assay. Here we report that 45% of these sequences functioned
	reproducibly as tissue-specific enhancers of gene expression at embryonic
	day 11.5. While directing expression in a broad range of anatomical
	structures in the embryo, the majority of the 75 enhancers directed
	expression to various regions of the developing nervous system. We
	identified sequence signatures enriched in a subset of these elements
	that targeted forebrain expression, and used these features to rank
	all approximately 3,100 non-coding elements in the human genome that
	are conserved between human and Fugu. The testing of the top predictions
	in transgenic mice resulted in a threefold enrichment for sequences
	with forebrain enhancer activity. These data dramatically expand
	the catalogue of human gene enhancers that have been characterized

  journal = {Neural Dev},
  year = {2009},
  volume = {4},
  pages = {43},
  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Agenesis of the corpus callosum is associated with many
	human developmental syndromes. Key mechanisms regulating callosal
	formation include the guidance of axons arising from pioneering neurons
	in the cingulate cortex and the development of cortical midline glial
	populations, but their molecular regulation remains poorly characterised.
	Recent data have shown that mice lacking the transcription factor
	Nfib exhibit callosal agenesis, yet neocortical callosal neurons
	express only low levels of Nfib. Therefore, we investigate here how
	Nfib functions to regulate non-cell-autonomous mechanisms of callosal
	formation. RESULTS: Our investigations confirmed a reduction in glial
	cells at the midline in Nfib-/- mice. To determine how this occurs,
	we examined radial progenitors at the cortical midline and found
	that they were specified correctly in Nfib mutant mice, but did not
	differentiate into mature glia. Cellular proliferation and apoptosis
	occurred normally at the midline of Nfib mutant mice, indicating
	that the decrease in midline glia observed was due to deficits in
	differentiation rather than proliferation or apoptosis. Next we investigated
	the development of callosal pioneering axons in Nfib-/- mice. Using
	retrograde tracer labelling, we found that Nfib is expressed in cingulate
	neurons and hence may regulate their development. In Nfib-/- mice,
	neuropilin 1-positive axons fail to cross the midline and expression
	of neuropilin 1 is diminished. Tract tracing and immunohistochemistry
	further revealed that, in late gestation, a minor population of neocortical
	axons does cross the midline in Nfib mutants on a C57Bl/6J background,
	forming a rudimentary corpus callosum. Finally, the development of
	other forebrain commissures in Nfib-deficient mice is also aberrant.
	CONCLUSION: The formation of the corpus callosum is severely delayed
	in the absence of Nfib, despite Nfib not being highly expressed in
	neocortical callosal neurons. Our results indicate that in addition
	to regulating the development of midline glial populations, Nfib
	also regulates the expression of neuropilin 1 within the cingulate
	cortex. Collectively, these data indicate that defects in midline
	glia and cingulate cortex neurons are associated with the callosal
	dysgenesis seen in Nfib-deficient mice, and provide insight into
	how the development of these cellular populations is controlled at
	a molecular level.},

  abstract = {Cell-fate transitions involve the integration of genomic information
	encoded by regulatory elements, such as enhancers, with the cellular
	environment. However, identification of genomic sequences that control
	human embryonic development represents a formidable challenge. Here
	we show that in human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), unique chromatin
	signatures identify two distinct classes of genomic elements, both
	of which are marked by the presence of chromatin regulators p300
	and BRG1, monomethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me1), and
	low nucleosomal density. In addition, elements of the first class
	are distinguished by the acetylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27ac),
	overlap with previously characterized hESC enhancers, and are located
	proximally to genes expressed in hESCs and the epiblast. In contrast,
	elements of the second class, which we term 'poised enhancers', are
	distinguished by the absence of H3K27ac, enrichment of histone H3
	lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), and are linked to genes inactive
	in hESCs and instead are involved in orchestrating early steps in
	embryogenesis, such as gastrulation, mesoderm formation and neurulation.
	Consistent with the poised identity, during differentiation of hESCs
	to neuroepithelium, a neuroectoderm-specific subset of poised enhancers
	acquires a chromatin signature associated with active enhancers.
	When assayed in zebrafish embryos, poised enhancers are able to direct
	cell-type and stage-specific expression characteristic of their proximal
	developmental gene, even in the absence of sequence conservation
	in the fish genome. Our data demonstrate that early developmental
	enhancers are epigenetically pre-marked in hESCs and indicate an
	unappreciated role of H3K27me3 at distal regulatory elements. Moreover,
	the wealth of new regulatory sequences identified here provides an
	invaluable resource for studies and isolation of transient, rare
	cell populations representing early stages of human embryogenesis.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Evolutionarily conserved sequences within or adjoining
	orthologous genes often serve as critical cis-regulatory regions.
	Recent studies have identified long, non-coding genomic regions that
	are perfectly conserved between human and mouse, termed ultra-conserved
	regions (UCRs). Here, we focus on UCRs that cluster around genes
	involved in early vertebrate development; genes conserved over 450
	million years of vertebrate evolution. RESULTS: Based on a high resolution
	detection procedure, our UCR set enables novel insights into vertebrate
	genome organization and regulation of developmentally important genes.
	We find that the genomic positions of deeply conserved UCRs are strongly
	associated with the locations of genes encoding key regulators of
	development, with particularly strong positional correlation to transcription
	factor-encoding genes. Of particular importance is the observation
	that most UCRs are clustered into arrays that span hundreds of kilobases
	around their presumptive target genes. Such a hallmark signature
	is present around several uncharacterized human genes predicted to
	encode developmentally important DNA-binding proteins. CONCLUSION:
	The genomic organization of UCRs, combined with previous findings,
	suggests that UCRs act as essential long-range modulators of gene
	expression. The exceptional sequence conservation and clustered structure
	suggests that UCR-mediated molecular events involve greater complexity
	than traditional DNA binding by transcription factors. The high-resolution
	UCR collection presented here provides a wealth of target sequences
	for future experimental studies to determine the nature of the biochemical
	mechanisms involved in the preservation of arrays of nearly identical
	non-coding sequences over the course of vertebrate evolution.},

	Parallel searches have been performed with multiple alignments of
	four insect species (three species of Drosophila and Anopheles gambiae),
	two species of Caenorhabditis, and seven species of Saccharomyces.
	Conserved elements were identified with a computer program called
	phastCons, which is based on a two-state phylogenetic hidden Markov
	model (phylo-HMM). PhastCons works by fitting a phylo-HMM to the
	data by maximum likelihood, subject to constraints designed to calibrate

	melanogaster (37%-53%), Caenorhabditis elegans (18%-37%), and Saccharaomyces

	of increasing genome size and general biological complexity, increasing
	fractions of conserved bases are found to lie outside of the exons

	elements (HCEs), by log-odds score, are hundreds or thousands of
	bases long. These elements share certain properties with ultraconserved
	elements, but they tend to be longer and less perfectly conserved,
	and they overlap genes of somewhat different functional categories.
	In vertebrates, HCEs are associated with the 3' UTRs of regulatory
	genes, stable gene deserts, and megabase-sized regions rich in moderately
	conserved noncoding sequences. Noncoding HCEs also show strong statistical
	evidence of an enrichment for RNA secondary structure.},

	a 72-hour time course. We observed a widespread oscillatory-like
	pattern of changes in gene expression, involving components of both
	the canonical and the noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways. A higher-order,
	systems-level analysis that combined independent component analysis,
	waveform analysis, and mutual information-based network construction
	revealed effects on pathways related to cell death and neurodegenerative
	disease. Wnt effectors were tightly clustered with presenilin1 (PSEN1)
	and granulin (GRN), which cause dominantly inherited forms of Alzheimer's
	disease and frontotemporal dementia (FTD), respectively. We further
	explored a potential link between Wnt1 and GRN and found that Wnt1
	decreased GRN expression by hNPs. Conversely, GRN knockdown increased
	WNT1 expression, demonstrating that Wnt and GRN reciprocally regulate
	each other. Finally, we provided in vivo validation of the in vitro
	findings by analyzing gene expression data from individuals with
	FTD. These unbiased and genome-wide analyses provide evidence for
	a connection between Wnt signaling and the transcriptional regulation
	of neurodegenerative disease genes.},

	aspects of medical genetics and human evolution. In the past, estimates
	of mutation rates have generally been inferred from phenotypic observations
	or comparisons of homologous sequences among closely related species.
	Here, we apply new sequencing technology to measure directly one
	mutation rate, that of base substitutions on the human Y chromosome.
	The Y chromosomes of two individuals separated by 13 generations
	were flow sorted and sequenced by Illumina (Solexa) paired-end sequencing
	to an average depth of 11x or 20x, respectively. Candidate mutations
	were further examined by capillary sequencing in cell-line and blood
	DNA from the donors and additional family members. Twelve mutations
	were confirmed in approximately 10.15 Mb; eight of these had occurred
	in vitro and four in vivo. The latter could be placed in different
	positions on the pedigree and led to a mutation-rate measurement
	of 3.0 x 10(-8) mutations/nucleotide/generation (95\% CI: 8.9 x 10(-9)-7.0
	x 10(-8)), consistent with estimates of 2.3 x 10(-8)-6.3 x 10(-8)
	mutations/nucleotide/generation for the same Y-chromosomal region
	from published human-chimpanzee comparisons depending on the generation
	and split times assumed.},

	target regions. This association is biologically important, as E2A
	is critical for mesendoderm specification, gastrulation, and Nodal
	signal transduction in Xenopus tropicalis embryos. Taken together,
	E proteins are novel Nodal signaling cofactors that associate with
	SMAD2/3 and FOXH1 and are necessary for mesendoderm differentiation.},
